To run the search engine:
    either change 'caption_string' in the top of the file to what you want to search for, and than run, or
    call include.main.search_engine.run_search_engine(XXX), with as an argument (XXX) the search string
    you want to search for.

Following Errors may occur:
    FileNotFoundException: resolve this error by altering the directories to the model, vectorizer, etc.
    in the top of the file


Note: the search_engine is build on the simple model, a more complex and far more efficient model was created later,
but has not yet been added/made available via the search_engine module. This will be accomplished in future versions
of the project
